I  have really been enjoying this class. I really like doing the coding and the css. I felt like I have been able to comprehend everything pretty well. I really think this is something I could do when I am older. I have been really enjoying learning all of these new things and seeing the results after I couldn't figure something out. I am also excited to learn new languages and different things.
